<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Beginning API Development**

I'm starting on the user registration API, focusing on getting it right this time. I'll be referencing the workflow document for guidance. My goal is to create a robust and functional API.


**Defining Endpoint Functionality**

I've moved on to the core logic. I'm focusing on defining the endpoint's responsibilities: validating input (username and password) and implementing secure password hashing before saving the new user to the database. Currently, I'm examining the PRD, API, and ERD documents to ensure alignment.


**Analyzing Task Requirements**

I've examined the task's requirements. The goal is a registration API endpoint, and I'll use the 'WORKFLOW.md' document as a guide. Based on the documentation in `TOD OLIST.md`, I've started defining the necessary validations, data structures, and the flow for creating a new user, including password hashing. The  validation of the endpoint is a crucial aspect, and the error code returns are critical.


**Starting Task Analysis**

I'm now diving into the user registration API task. My plan is to start by examining relevant documentation. I need to understand this fully, referencing the workflow guide for direction. I plan to use Test-Driven Development. I have started by defining a solid test framework to make sure the endpoint works as designed.


**Starting Task Analysis Again**

I'm now fully immersed in the task of creating the user registration API. I've re-examined the documentation, paying close attention to the `TODOLIST.md`, `PRD.md`, `API.md`, and `ERD.md` files. I've noted a potential discrepancy between the `ERD.md` requiring a `nickname` and the `API.md` only requesting `username` and `password`. I plan to raise this with the user for clarification. My next steps involve generating the necessary Git commands as per the workflow.


**Analyzing Plan Inconsistencies**

I've carefully examined the documentation, as per the workflow. I've noted a significant discrepancy between the `ERD.md` requiring a `nickname` field and the `API.md` only specifying `username` and `password` for registration. Moreover, the API response doesn't include the `nickname` either. This inconsistency needs clarification before proceeding. I'll need to halt any new development until this is clarified.


**Commencing Task Initialization**

I'm ready to begin the task. I've analyzed the documentation, particularly noting the discrepancy regarding the `nickname` field in the `ERD.md` compared to the API documentation. To proceed, I'll assume the username will be used as a default nickname for now, and I'll flag this as a potential issue for clarification. I will now create the feature branch, following the workflow's Git commands.



**Preparing for API Implementation**

I'm ready to proceed with the user registration API. I've re-examined the project documentation, particularly focusing on `TODOLIST.md`, `PRD.md`, `API.md`, and `ERD.md`. I've noted a potential discrepancy: the `ERD.md` requires a `nickname` field, while the API documentation does not.  To begin, I'll create a new branch and assume the username will be used as a default nickname, flagging this as an important clarification to raise.


**Beginning Task Implementation**

I'm ready to begin the task. I've analyzed the documentation, particularly noting the discrepancy regarding the `nickname` field in the `ERD.md` compared to the API documentation. To proceed, I'll assume the username will be used as a default nickname for now, and I'll flag this as a potential issue for clarification. I will now create the feature branch, following the workflow's Git commands.



**Beginning Task Execution**

I've initiated the user registration API task. Based on the provided documentation, I understand the core objective and the workflow. I'm ready to begin by creating a feature branch to isolate the development process. Here are the necessary Git commands:

```bash
git status
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/backend/auth-register-api
```
Please execute these commands to create your feature branch.


**Commencing Task Start**

I'm ready to proceed with the user registration API. I've re-examined project documentation, noting a discrepancy regarding the `nickname` field, where `ERD.md` shows it as mandatory, while API documentation omits it. For now, I'll assume the username as a default nickname and flag this for clarification later. I've initiated a new feature branch to implement the initial Git commands:


**Analyzing Git Initialization**

I've initiated the user registration API task. Based on the documentation, I understand the core objective and workflow. I'm proceeding by creating a feature branch to isolate the development. My initial action will be to execute the following Git commands: `git status`
